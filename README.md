# Unit 6 - Natural Language Processing Project

## Introduction

Natural language processing (NLP) is used in many apps and devices to interact with users and make meaning of text to determine how to respond, find information, or to create new text. Your goal is to use natural language processing techniques to identify structure, patterns, and meaning in a text to have conversations with a user, execute commands, perform manipulations on the text, or generate new text.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, ArrayLists, the String class, and algorithms to create a program that uses natural language processing techniques:

- **Create at least two ArrayLists** – Create at least two ArrayLists to store the data used in your program, such as data from text files or entered by the user.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use loops and conditionals to find or manipulate elements in an ArrayList or String object.
- **Use methods in the String classs** - Use one or more methods in the String class in your program, such as to divide text into sentences or phrases.
- **Use at least one natural language processing technique** – Use a natural language processing technique to process, analyze, and/or generate text.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Project Description

Our code is a password checker that can run through a list of passwords or the user's inputted password. The code runs through the “passwords.txt” file and checks if those passwords are “Weak”, “Medium”, or “Strong”. It than asks the user if they would like to check a password and they say no, the program is completed. If they say yes, they can input any password of their choice and press enter. Once they press enter it will tell them if their password is “Weak”, “Medium”, or “Strong” and the program is completed. We created this so people can identify if their password is safe to use but can also check multiple passcodes at once. This could be helpful for apps or websites to use if it requires users to make accounts. This gives users extra verification that the information they are inputting will make it harder for others to access their accounts.
